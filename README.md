# cppplaydesignpatterns
simple modern c++ design patterns

for these use cases
adapter -> wrap an existing library, provide specific functionality to meet the needs of the consumers of the api
builder -> object oriented, separate construction of complex object from its representation so that the same construction
process can create different representations
composite -> identify scalar/primitive classes and vector container classes. all concrete classes implement an interface, they are
all interchangeable. all concrete classes have is a relationship to interface. all container classes couple themselves to interface.
recursive composition, composite has a set of children up the is a hierarchy. container classes use polymorphism as they delegate to
their children







working software is the goal. as fast and good as possible. write simple, efficient, maintainable code.
